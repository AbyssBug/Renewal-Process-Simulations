# Renewal-Process-Simulations

 a. simulate sum of random variables of the different distributions to cross given number 
 b. simulate inspection paradox for discrete, Poisson and other continuous distributions
 c. Simulate renewal process given the distribution with parameters e.g. Uniform and the Normal.  Find theoretical values for such runs and also simulate and show values
  Visualize renewal process
